        <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="img\about-img.jpg" alt>
        <p>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers 
           to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the internet using 
           a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website
           of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using 
           a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability 
           and pricing at different e-retaliers. As of 2016, customers can stop online
           using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers,laptops,
           tablet computers and smartphones.</p>

        <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
        <br>
        <h4 style="color:blue;"> 1960 </h4>
        <p>One of the earliest forms of trade conducted online was IBM's 
            online transaction processing (OLTP) developed in the 1960s</p><br>
        <h4 style="color:blue;">1985</h4>
        <p>The processing of financial transactions in real-time.The computerized
        ticket reservation system developed for American Airlines called Semi-Automatic
        Business Research Environment (SABRE) was one of its application.</p><br>
        <h4 style="color:blue;">1990</h4>
        <p>Here, computer terminals located in different travel agencies were linked 
            to<br>a large IBM mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously
        and coordinate them so that all travel agents had access to the same information
        at the same information at the same time.<br>The emergence of online shopping
        as we know today developed with the emergence of the Internet.</p><br>

        <h3>GROWTH</h3>
        <br>
        <p> Growth in online shoppers <br> As the revenues from online sales continued
            to grow significantly researches identified different types of online shoppers,
            Rohm & Swaninathan[7] identified four categories and named them "convenience 
            shoppers, variety seekers, balanced buyers, and store-oriented shoppers". They
            focused on shopping motivations and found that the variety of products 
            available and the perceived convenience of the buying online experience were
            significant motivating factors.</p>
